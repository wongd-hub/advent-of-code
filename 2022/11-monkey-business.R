# 11 Monkey in the Middle ----

#' Monkeys have decided to throw your belongings around. You notice that how the
#' monkeys decide who to throw to next is based on your worry level for each
#' item.
#' 
#' A single monkey's instruction looks like this:
#' 
#' Monkey I:
#'  Starting items: X, Y
#'  Operation: new = old * 19
#'  Test: divisible by 23
#'    If true: throw to monkey 2
#'    If false: throw to monkey 3
#'    
#' Starting items lists what items the monkey will inspect in order. Operation
#' determines how your worry level changes when the monkey inspects the item.
#' Test provides the decision rule which determines who the monkey throws to.
#' 
#' After a monkey inspects an item, but before it assesses your worry level, you
#' are relieved the monkey didn't break the item and your worry divides by 3 and
#' rounds down to the nearest integer.
#' 
#' When an item is throw to a monkey, it enters the back of their queue to be
#' inspected upon the next round, keeping all worry transforms that have
#' occurred to it until then.
#' 
#' A monkey's turn goes like this for each item it holds, in order
#'  - Monkey inspects item with worry level X
#'  - Your worry is multiplied by 19 (X * 19)
#'  - You are relieved they didn't break the item, your worry divides by 3 (floor((X * 19) / 3))
#'  - Current worry is not divisible by 23, throw to monkey 3
#'  
#' A full round ends once each monkey has taken their turn. Then the round
#' starts again with each monkey's updated queue. After 20 rounds, which 2
#' monkeys inspected the most items? Calculate the monkey business (throws x
#' throws) for these two monkeys.

## 11b Part 2 ----

# In this part of the question, our worry is no longer divided by 3 each time
# the item is inspected. This means our worry levels will quickly blow out of
# what we can store in the memory limits of integers and probably also bigints.

# Because of this, we'll need to redefine how we perform the test for which
# monkey to throw to since that is the only part that worry levels actually
# affect.

# The main components of the test are as follows:
# - The current worry level of the item, which is a product of multiple 
#   operations that led up to that point.
#    The issue is that the operations can be addition, multiplication or 
#    squaring, making storing the order of operations difficult.
#    Also, the documentation (?`%%`) states that "For double arguments, %% 
#    can be subject to catastrophic loss of accuracy if x is much larger than 
#    y, and a warning is given if this is detected"
# - The number to divide by (division_test)

# We're going to use modular arithmetic, which in a nutshell allows us to wrap
# numbers around the modulus. Another thing to note is that all division tests
# are prime, which might come in handy later.
#  - Instead of operating directly on the calculated worry level, we will take 
#    the modulus of the worry level after each operation is performed.
#  - We can then continue to operate on the modulus as usual, as long as we keep 
#    taking the modulus of the result.
#  - Note this works for addition, multiplication and squaring, but not division 
#    (we don't need to divide by anything here - if we did we would need to find 
#    the modular multiplicative inverse).

# This keeps our tracked number small (smaller than the modulus/division test),
# while still giving us the same answer - whether the number is divisible by the
# division test.

# For a good explanation on modular arithmetic, see this video:
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ3CD9M3nEQ
